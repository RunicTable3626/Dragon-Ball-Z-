HI!!

Welcome to my attempt at a tribute to Legend of Goku: Buu's Fury,
a GBA game that I played during my childhood.

This is more an interactive cutscene than a full fledged game.

Use the Up Button to navigate through cutscenes.
Use the Up, Down, Left, Right Buttons to control the spirit bomb towards Majin Buu.
Use the Select Button at any point, to reset the game to the title screen.

I hope you have a good time!
